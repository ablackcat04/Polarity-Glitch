# Polarity Glitch

## Overview

Polarity Glitch is a simple but uniquely sound audio plugin, 
which will invert the polarity of the input signal on a probability basis, 
creating a glitchy-metallic sound.

We only provide VST3 and AU now, but since we use the JUCE C++ framework, 
you can build other supported plugin formats as you want.

### How to set up
